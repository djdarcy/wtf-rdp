## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-08
### Added
- Initial `wtf-rdp` aggregator CLI (`rdp`) built on `dazzlecmd-lib`.
- `sessfix` kit with the `status` tool (watchdog service state + recent rescues + live session table).
- Bundled assets: the `SYSTEM` watchdog service script (`Watch-RdpSession.ps1`), the RDP auto-connect test clicker (`Invoke-RdpConnect.ps1`), and `nssm.exe` — shipped as package data toward a self-contained `pip install`.
- Design record migrated to `private/` (postmortem, dev-workflow-process design, session-rescue watchdog design note) from the validation work on 2026-07-07: the `SYSTEM` `tscon` rescue mechanism and the autonomous detect→confirm→rescue loop, verified on a live target.
